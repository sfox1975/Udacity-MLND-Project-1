# Udacity-MLND-Project-1
Boston Housing Prices - Machine Learning

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to apply basic machine learning concepts on data collected for housing prices in the Boston, Massachusetts area to predict the selling price of a new home. This project is part of the Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree.

## Dataset
Housing data for 1970s Boston was used here. For further description, please refer to the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset is part of the sklearn.datasets module.

## Project Overview
I first explored the data to obtain important features and descriptive statistics about the dataset. Next, I split the data into testing and training subsets, and determined a suitable performance metric for this problem. I then nalyzed performance graphs for a learning algorithm with varying parameters and training set sizes, allowing me to pick the optimal model that best generalized for unseen data. Finally, I tested this optimal model on a new sample and compare the predicted selling price to the population statistics.

## Technical Highlights
This project was designed to get students acquainted with working with datasets in Python and applying basic machine learning techniques using NumPy and Scikit-Learn.

Technical skills learnt during this project:

* How to use NumPy to investigate the latent features of a dataset.
* How to analyze various learning performance plots for variance and bias.
* How to determine the best-guess model for predictions from unseen data.
* How to evaluate a modelâ€™s performance on unseen data using previous data.
